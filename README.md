# Elevator
Elevator Simulation - Coding Challenge

Welcome to the elevator simulation.

To get started simply run the program found inside the .sln file. 
As soon as the program is running you can check under the Elevator\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1 folder for the Elevator_Activity.log file.
In there you will be able to follow the elevator's activity. 

You may input request from inside (e.g. 2, 10)the elevator and from outside the elevator (e.g. 1D, 5U).

-Optional Routines:
Max weight routine will start when user enters M, this will ignore any outside requests. 
Max weight routine will stop when user enters R, this will allow outside requests.
Shutdown routine will start when user enters Q and all the existing requests have been fullfilled.
